Sanskrit Grammar Basics

Sanskrit is an ancient Indo-Aryan language with a rich grammatical tradition. Here are the fundamental concepts:

1. Sandhi (Combination Rules)
Sandhi refers to the phonetic changes that occur when words are combined. For example:
- a + a = ƒÅ (long a)
- a + i = e
- a + u = o

2. Verb Conjugation
Sanskrit verbs have three persons (first, second, third), three numbers (singular, dual, plural), and various tenses and moods.

3. Noun Declension
Sanskrit nouns decline in eight cases: nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, and vocative.

4. Common Sanskrit Words
- namaste = hello/greetings
- dharma = duty/righteousness
- karma = action/deed

- atman = soul/self
- brahman = ultimate reality

5. Basic Phrases
