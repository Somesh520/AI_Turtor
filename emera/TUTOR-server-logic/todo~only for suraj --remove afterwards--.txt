change name to SANTOR to NEXAS 

there shall be a button showing the lesson,and i shall have an option to select the lesson i want to learn, like an index(dropdown box)

only after completing the prev lesson i can go to next one, untill then it shouldn't unlock, but if i want to go through the prev lessons i can go through them any number of time i want.

when asked to start a lesson 

ask for what language they know and then teach in that language, English may not be a common language
